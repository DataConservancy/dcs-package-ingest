# Simple Data Conservancy Package Ingest Service #
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DataConservancy/dcs-package-ingest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DataConservancy/dcs-package-ingest)

This is a description of the package ingest service

## Usage ##
### Prerequisites ###
 - Oracle JDK 8
 - Apache Karaf 4.0+
 
### Operation
The simple package ingest service will monitor specified directories for the presence of 
[Data conservancy packages](http://dataconservancy.github.io/dc-packaging-spec/dc-packaging-spec-1.0.html). 
When packages are found, their contents are [ingested into a Fedora repository](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1709hcmO_lxUqDvCYKQuJ3XUvaywQFSxFGkt98EWvGRs).  This package ingest service
places additional semantics on Data Conservancy packages which influence how artifacts within them are ingested into Fedora.  In particular, it looks for additional statements in the [resource manifest file](http://dataconservancy.github.io/dc-packaging-spec/dc-packaging-spec-1.0.html#a3.2.3):
* Any resource `R` that is the subject of a statement `<R> <rdf:type> <ldp:Container>` will be created as a Container in Fedora
* For resources `R` and `C`, a statement `<R> <ldp:Contains> <C>` will result in `C` being ingested as member of the 
corresponding `R` container in Fedora.
* For any resource `R` that logically describes a resource `B`, and `B` is a binary resource (i.e not a domain object), 
presence of the statement `<R> <iana:describes> <B>` will result in B deposited as a NonRDFSource in Fedora, with the contents of `R` placed into the associated LDP-RS automatically created by Fedora as described in [ยง5.2.3.12](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#h-ldpc-post-createbinlinkmetahdr) of the LDP specification.

Addditionally, Fedora places its own restrictions on object content, such as a restriction that all triples in an object MUST have the same subject, inless that subject is a blank node.  All domain objects (indicated by `ore:aggregates` in the manifest file) will be ingested as Fedora objects, and therefore subject so such restrictions.
 
### Installation in Karaf ###
See [Karaf install instructions](package-ingest-karaf/README.md).  

### Configuration ###
See [Karaf configuration instructions](package-ingest-karaf/README.md#Configuration)


## Development ##

### Integration testing ###
Integration tests launch an instance of Fedora 4 for the entire (failsafe) integration test lifecycle duration.  To run all integration tests, simply do 
`mvn verify`

 The base URI for this instance is available to integration tests via the system property `fedora.baseURI`.  

The default port is 8080, but this can be changed via specifying a system property
`mvn -Dfedora.port=8090 ...`



### Running Fedora standalone ###
The embedded Fedora instance used for testing can be run manually via
`mvn cargo:run`

It may be run on a different port via
`mvn -Dfedora.port=8090 cargo:run`

The Fedora data directory is placed in `target`, so repository contents from the last run of tests (or manual changes) will be persisted until `mvn clean` is run.
